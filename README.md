# Project 2 for ATCM 3368

## Github Link
You're here already! No need to reiterate.

## Game Information
### Controls
  * Use the MOUSE to generally interact with menu elements.
  * WASD or ARROW KEYS move the character around once you're past the main menu.
  * SHIFT will increase your speed (and lower your turn speed) while it's held down.
  * LEFT-MOUSE BUTTON will do a quick shoot animation and play a sound, shooting a ray in a straight line.
  * SPACEBAR will make your character to jump.
  * ESCAPE opens up the pause menu which uh, pauses the game. Also lets you exit.

### Other Information
  * Targets will spawn pretty consistently and are worth 20 points if you shoot them.
  * Enemies will slowly ramp up in spawn and location and are worth 10 points if you destroy them (takes three shots!)
  * Crates will periodically spawn around the level. Some have health pickups in them (+10 health!), others have 2x score powerups in them.
  * There's a couple of powerups "hidden" around (okay, there's two, one health, one 2x score).

### Innovation
  * Randomized spawning (there's a few set elements of the level, but spawning after the first 5 seconds is entirely random).
  * Enemy spawning that ramps up slowly (takes about 60 seconds for the full set of spawns).
  * 2X Score Powerup and Health Pickup, both of which do exactly what you'd expect (they also rotate and bob up and down!).
  * Started using bloom. Not sure if that really counts.
  * The enemy projectiles are a little bouncy (but they only hurt once)!
