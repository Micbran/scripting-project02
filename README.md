You're here already! No need to reiterate.

## Game Information
### Controls
  * Use the MOUSE to generally interact with menu elements.
  * WASD or ARROW KEYS move the character around once you're past the main menu.
  * SHIFT will increase your speed (and lower your turn speed) while it's held down.
  * LEFT-MOUSE BUTTON will do a quick shoot animation and play a sound
  * SPACEBAR will make your character to jump.
  * ESCAPE opens up the pause menu which uh, pauses the game. Also lets you exit.

### Other Information
  * The BRIGHT RED RECTANGLE is a damage volume. It damages you (rate is 0.25 per tick)!
  * When you DIE (aka your health reaches ZERO), a loss menu will pop up, allowing you to either restart or go back to the main menu.
  * I know *why* the damage volume is hollow, I just don't know how to make it *not* hollow. So that's why it disappears if you clip into it.
  * "Clear Data" button doesn't really work yet, didn't bother implementing highscore clear until "score" is actually more important.
